`assets/css-ltr/` are the original stylesheets from the [readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable/) bootswatch.

`assets/css/` are these files after going through the [R2](https://github.com/ded/R2#readme) CSS right-to-left converter.

The parent theme is `site-rtl` that includes additional tweaks to make the rtl site "behave".
